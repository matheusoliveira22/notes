### EBS - Elastic Block Store
- An EBS is an network drive
- It allows data to be persisted even after the instance is terminated
	- Root volumes have the delete on termination atrribute set by default
- Can be assigned to only one instance at a time (except multi-attach feature)
- They have a provisioned capacity
- They are locked in an specific AZ
	- To move an EBS volume from an AZ to another AZ, first you must take an snapshot of it, and then create a new volume in the desired location
	- To move an EBS to another region, you can copy the snapshot to the desired region, and then recreate the volume there
- EBS Snapshots features:
	- Snapshot archive: Archive the snapshot, making it cost way lower (up to 75% less), but you'll need to wait up to 72h to use then when needed
	- Recicle Bin For Snapshots: Snapshots aren't directly deleted, so you can retrieve then if the deletion was a mistake (configurable from 1 day to up to 1 year after the deletion)
	- Fast Snapshot Restore: Force full restore of the snapshot to have no latency on first use (costing more)
- EBS Volume types:
	- gp2/gp3 - General Purporse SSD: Balance performance, storage and price (Best for most workloads)
		- Max size of 16 TiB
		- gp2 - size of the volume and IOPS are linked at a rate of 3 IOPs per Gb to the max of 16000 IOPS
		- gp3 - baseline of 3000 IOPS and 125 MB/s. Can increase up to 16000 IOPS and 1000 MB/s independently
	- io1/io2 - Highest Performance SSDs for mission critical, low-latency or high throughput workloads
	- st1 (HDD) - Low cost HDD volume designed to be used frequently
	- sc1 (HDD) - Low cost HDD volume designed to be used less frequently
	- **Only SSDs can be used as root volumes**
	- Provisioned IOPS
		- Critical business applications with constant IOPS requirements or that requere more than 16000 IOPS
		- Great for database workloads
		- io1:
			- Max PIOPS 64000 for nitro EC2 instances or 32000 for others
			- Can increase IOPs and throughput independently of size
		- io2:
		- 

### Instance Store
- Fisical drive attached to the instance
- Higher I/O performance
- Ephemeral, data only lives while the instance is running
- Backups and replication are our resposability
- Use cases: Buffer, cache, temporary content
