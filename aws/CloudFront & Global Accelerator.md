• CloudFront
	• Improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos)
	• Dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery)
	• Content is served at the edge
• Global Accelerator
	• Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP
	• Proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.
	• Good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP
	• Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses
	• Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover
	• Perform health checks in the underlying application
