In this setup we'll be following along the steps provided in the course by [mischavandenburg](https://github.com/mischavandenburg) using Rancher Desktop.
### Steps required to setup local lab for kubernetes

1. Install [Rancher Desktop for Linux](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/getting-started/installation/#linux) (not executing the steps for using docker login)
2. Install [Homebrew Package Manager](https://brew.sh/)
3. Install the following packages:
```bash
brew install kubectl k9s
sudo apt install tmux vim
```

**Important:** We'll start using Rancher Desktop but it should not interfere with the learning curve when we need to use k3s, since it should be a natural progression
