**Kubernetes is the operating system of the cloud. It's an intelligent way of running container works at scale.**

In essence, it's a bunch of virtual machines, witch are able to communicate properly with each other to divide their workload. Kubernetes han an control plane of the VMs (worker nodes) [[3. Kubernetes Control Plane]]. 
Given an request to provide more pods to an application, it'll automatically make the provision in it's worker nodes, balancing the workload.
Obs.: In the cloud, Kubernetes also has the capacity to provision a new worker node if it evaluate that this will be necessary
