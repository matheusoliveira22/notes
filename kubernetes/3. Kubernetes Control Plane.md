##### The Kubernetes Control Plane has the following structure:

1. **API Server**
		Responsible for receiving and fullfilling the requests from the command line tools like kubectl, k9s, etc
		Example: When you run kubectl run ngnix --image=ngnix, this request will be forwarded to the control plane API configured in ~/.kube/config with the current namespace. The API will then create an schedule for creating the pod in the cluster.
2. **Scheduler**
	   Assigns pod to a node, taking requests and make the decision on where the pod will be placed.
3. **ETCD**


##### Definitions
- **Pod**
	  A Pod is the smallest element on a kubernetes cluster
	  It consists on a collection of containers + other resources
	  Pod definition:
		  1. Single Container: Pod defined by a single container
		  2. Multi Container: Pod defined by a collection of containers
		  3. Initcontainer: Define processes that must have been completed before the container can be started. (e.g. check if could connect to a database)
		  4. Networking: Define information about the pod network connectivity (e.g. IP address)
		  5. Storage: Define information about the volumes the pod will interact with to read/write information
